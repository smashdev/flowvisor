REQUIREMENTS:
    
    Running flowvisor at 0.8.x version.

CONVERSION:
   
    To convert the xml file to the json format, run:

    fvconfig convert config.xml

    This will return a config.json file in the same
    directory.

LOADING:

    Two options available:

    1. Start flowvisor with config file parameter

        flowvisor config.json

    NOTE: This will overwrite contents of the database
    with the configuration file. Make sure the database 
    and config file are in sync by dumping the config
    from a runnning flowvisor by:

        fvctl dumpConfig config.json

    Otherwise any undumped config will be lost.

    
    2. (RECOMMENDED) Loading the config into flowvisor
       before starting.

        fvconfig load config.json
