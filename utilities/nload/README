Stupid program; sums up all packets that go by that match
given tcpdump-style filter.

Compile with gmake (sorry, not makefile independent -- could be changed
trivially).

Requires libpcap.


If pcap.h is not in the standard path, add "CFLAGS+=-I/path/to/pcap.h" to
make on the command line.  Ditto for "LDFLAGS+=-L/path/to/libpcap.a",
and LIBS for extra libs. 

I.e.

gmake CFLAGS+=-I/path/to/pcap.h LDFLAGS+=-L/path/to/libpcap.a LIBS+=-lresolv \
	LIBS+=-lnsl

is needed to compile for solaris.

This was writen (and looks like :) as an hour long project.  If people
enjoy it, and want new functionality, lemme know, and I will see
what I can do.
