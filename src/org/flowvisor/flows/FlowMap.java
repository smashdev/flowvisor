/**
 * Interface for computing intersections in flowspace.
 *
 * FlowSpace rules are described via a strict priority list, e.g.,
 *
 * RULE 0: FlowEntry 0: if , then ACTIONS LIST 0 RULE 1: FlowEntry 1: if RULE 1,
 * then ACTIONS LIST 1 . . . RULE N: FlowEntry N: ...
 *
 * FlowEntry's are allowed to overlap in FlowSpace, but intersections are
 * resolved by priority, and a single point in flowspace only *matches* one
 * rule. For example, if FlowEntry 1 affects all TCP traffic and FlowEntry 2
 * affects all IP traffic in prefix 192.168.0.0/16, then:
 *
 * TCP traffic outside of 192.168.0.0/16 will match Rule 1 (no intersection)
 * Non-TCP IP traffic in 192.168.0.0/16 will match Rule 2 (no intersection) TCP
 * traffic in 192.168.0.0/16 will match Rule 1 (intersection, but resolved by
 * priority)
 *
 * NOTE: this behavior emulates that of a TCAM
 *
 * Thus, the matches on a single packet only returns one FlowEntry.
 *
 * However, matches on a region (i.e., OFMatch with wildcards) can return
 * multiple entries
 *
